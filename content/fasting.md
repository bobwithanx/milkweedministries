All who love Jesus and who love justice are invited the first day of each month to pray and fast on behalf of vulnerable populations, as well as for restoration within the Church.

#### Rationale
Politics aside, we all have the biblical responsibility to love others, especially the stranger, the poor, and the weak, for whom God and His Son incarnate Jesus Christ advocated throughout the Old and New Testament. We can all agree there has been severe division in our land, and we are in desperate need of healing so we can be restored to one another and welcome others as we have been welcomed. Only our Creator and Redeemer can do this. Will you please consider taking time each month to pray for His intervention in His way, which is beyond our human understanding?

#### The Fast
The fast lasts for 24 hours on the first day of every month. You can purpose to fast for one meal, such as lunch, or all day long. If you have health needs or are pregnant or nursing, you may choose to fast from a type of food instead of all food. Please pray on how you will fast; we will not be policing you!

#### The Scripture & Prayer
Please read and pray Isaiah 58. For those who want to be more specific in their prayers, you can pray for the following, one per hour as you’re able. Here is an example schedule:
