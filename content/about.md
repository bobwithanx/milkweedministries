# ABOUT THE FOUNDER
Jessica S. Marquis drinks a lot of coffee, but mostly decaf. That is for everyoneâ€™s best. She is the founder of Milkweed Ministries, including [Verses 3 to 5](http://www.verses3to5.com) and [CAST](http://www.castogether.com) (Coming Alive, Scheming Together) event series, as well as the author of the humorous how-to book [Raising Unicorns](http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Unicorns-Step-Step-Successful/dp/1440525900) (Adams Media). She holds an MA in Counseling with a specialization in Couple and Family Studies from [Oakland University](http://www.oakland.edu). By day, she hangs out at home and around Phoenix with her daughter and twin sons; by night, she tries to stay awake to hold coherent conversations with her husband. You can catch her musings on spirituality at [Cottonwood Blessings](http://www.jessicasmarquis.com/blog) (and her unicorn news updates at [Unicornomics](http://unicornomics.com/)).
