Wailing Women is a monthly event for women that involves prayer and lamenting for the injustices that so many experience each and every day. It is for those who struggle with the juxtaposition of having much hope for our later days, and yet still experiencing despair. Each month we have a different prayer focus, which have included Racial Trauma, Women, and Immigration.

This event series is brought about through a partnership between [Be YOUnique](https://www.facebook.com/beYOUniqueAZ/) and Milkweed Ministries. Information on upcoming services can be found on the [Wailing Women Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WailingWomen/).

*Thus says the Lord of hosts,<br>
“Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come;<br>
And send for the wailing women, that they may come!<br>
“Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us,<br>
That our eyes may shed tears<br>
And our eyelids flow with water.*

*Thus says the Lord, “Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the Lord who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,” declares the Lord.*

Jeremiah 9: 17-18; 23-24
