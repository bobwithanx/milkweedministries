CAST (Coming Alive, Scheming Together) is an inclusive event series that connects justice-minded women, and those who identify as women, who love Jesus. It is what you get when you mix women + TED-style talks + a variety show with social justice flare + the Spiritâ€™s movement. We operate as a switchboard, connecting you with ideas, people, and organizations so you can plug in with your unique passions and gifts.

CAST involves two parts: The first features speakers and artists who present on a common theme; the second is a time to interact with presenters and participants to discuss and scheme together around what took place in the first part.
